Grow the size of the window until sum is greater or equal to target size.  
Then shrink the size until the sum is still greater or equal to the target size. This way we discard redundant numbers to keep just bare minimum required.

Once the sum becomes less than target size, increase window size right side and repeat the steps to find global minimum required numbers.
